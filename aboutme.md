Science
-------

I'm currently a Ph. D. candidate in the [Department of Botany and Plant
Pathology][bpp] at [Oregon State University][osu]. My research centers around
the population genetics of plant pathogens in the genus *Phytophthora*.
Specifically, I develop computational tools for analyzing clonal populations in
the R package [poppr][poppr].

Radio
-----

In January of 2012, [Joey Hulbert][joey] and I began interviewing graduate
students at OSU about the inspiration for their research. This developed into
the [award-winning][awd] radio program [Inspiration Dissemination][id] on OSU's
student-run radio station, [KBVR][kbvr] (88.7 FM).

Our mission is to engage and inspire undergraduates to pursue graduate research
by sharing the personal stories of graduate students at OSU each week. 

Interests
----

Beyond Science and Communication, these are a few of my favorite things
(incomplete list in no particular order):

 - listening to and playing music (I enjoy [several forms][lastfm])
 - baking
 - cats
 - science fiction and literature
