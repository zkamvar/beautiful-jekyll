Science
-------


I have graduated with a Ph. D. from the [Department of Botany and Plant
Pathology][bpp] at [Oregon State University][osu]. [My dissertation][diss]
focuses on my development of computational tools for analyzing clonal
populations in the R package [poppr][poppr]. I will be starting a post-doctoral
postion in the lab of [Sydney E. Everhart][see] at the [Department of Plant
Pathology at University of Nebraska, Lincoln][unl] in January of 2017.

Radio
-----

In January of 2012, [Joey Hulbert][joey] and I began interviewing graduate
students at OSU about the inspiration for their research. This developed into
the [award-winning][awd] radio program [Inspiration Dissemination][id] on OSU's
student-run radio station, [KBVR][kbvr] (88.7 FM).

Our mission is to engage and inspire undergraduates to pursue graduate research
by sharing the personal stories of graduate students at OSU each week. 

Interests
----

Beyond Science and Communication, these are a few of my favorite things
(incomplete list in no particular order):

 - listening to and playing music (I enjoy [several forms][lastfm])
 - baking
 - cats
 - science fiction and literature
